Installation
============

To use the **ChemicalDice** package, you need to install it along
with its dependencies. You can install ChemicalDice and its
dependencies using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ChemicalDice==1.0.2 scikit-learn torch tensorly

This command installs Featuredice along with the required
dependencies **scikit-learn**, **torch**, and **tensorly**.
Make sure to have the appropriate versions of these packages compatible
with Featuredice version 1.0.0.
